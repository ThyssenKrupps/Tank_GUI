CHANGE MANAGEMENT PROCESS	131. IntroductionThe Storage Tank Design Automation is a system that will automate the design process of a storage tank system (including pump, line and valve specifications) from the specifications document through to the calculations, system layout drawings and project summary. Minimal input will be required from the user.The system will be based on a Windows desktop application and users will have to have all the relevant software installed on their computers. MethodologyThe Software Development Life Cycle is a development process which helps through the planning, analysis, design, implementation and support of an application in order to improve the quality of software and the overall development process. SDLC comprises of six phases:Planning and requirement analysisThis phase consist of providing an overview document of the project’s goals which relates to the project requirements and scopeDefining requirementsIn this phase of the SDLC, after the requirements have been analyzed from the first phase, product requirements must be clearly defined, documented, and must be approved by the client or customer.Designing the product architectureBased on the requirements that have already been specified, this phase defines all the architectural modules of the product with its communication and data flow representation with the external and third party modules.Building or developing the productThe actual development start and the product is built at this stage. The design is performed in a detailed and organized manner and therefore codes can be easily accomplished.Testing the productTesting is normally included in all stages of the SDLC but this stage refers to testing only the stage of the product where product defects are tracked, reported, fixed, and retested until the product reaches the defined quality standards.Deployment and maintenanceIn this stage the product is deployed after the product has been tested and ready. PurposeThe Leads to Leads management system is a web application that will include all the requirements and functionalities necessary that will help engineers to simplify the Leads to Leads process effectively and efficiently.In order to get the services the application will offer, the users (ThyssenKrupp Admin and employee) will have to be connected to the internet. This will help to facilitate the Leads to Leads fertile ground process.  ScopeThere are two basic users- ThyssenKrupp admin and Employee.All users have their own profile.Admin can view, create, update and delete employee’s profile.An Employee can logon to the system. He/she do what he is responsible to do and commit after he has done and also can be able to print out the report and attached a document as a proof. Definitions, Acronyms, and AbbreviationsC# is an object-oriented programming language used with XML-based Web services on the .NET platform and designed for improving productivity in the development of Web applications.Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft.

General DescriptionA lead to lead management system is one that will be used by engineers or employers to easily management fertile ground process. The system will use computer-aided software engineering that will manage the system easily. It will also use different programming languages that perform different features and that will make the system request and respond faster. The system will allow admin to do the following requirements:Specific requirements are:Create employee’s login detailsView employee’s profile.Update employee’s profile.Delete employee’s profile from the system.2.1 Product PerspectiveThe product of the system will be a system management that will help ThyssenKrupp engineers to manage Leads to Leads fertile ground process. It is a web based Leads to Leads management system.The following are the main features that will be included in Leads to Leads management system:Cross platform support: Offers operating support for most of the known and commercial operating systems.User account: The system allows admin to create employees account in the system and provide features of updating and viewing profiles.Leads to lead management system: The system will allow the engineer to easily manage fertile ground process. The system will also allow an employee to login first.2.2 Product FunctionsThe Leads to lead management system will perform the following functions:Upload documentThe system allow user to upload document on the system.Print ReportThe system will allow user print or save report for employers. Save information The system will save all the information on the database for future use. RegisterThe system will allow admin to register all the engineers who are permitted to use the system and the system will generate logins details for each user.Login and LogoutThe system must allow the user to login with the provided login details and also logout after a user wishes to end the login session.2.3 User CharacteristicsThe system will consider two different type of users and each user will perform different function in the system.2.3.1. Employee          The employee is a type of user that will interact with the system daily to manage Leads to Leads fertile ground process. Employee must have access to the internet, and must be familiar with the usage of the basic Graphical User Interface (GUI).2.3.2 AdminAdmin will interact with the system to view and update employees profile or to deal with employees issues. This user is expected to be familiar with the interface of the tech support system.Use caseDescriptionSign inAdmin must sign in to…Add employee profileAdmin has to add employee profile containing personal detailsView employee profileAdmin can view an employee’s profileUpdate employee profileAdmin has the option to update employee’s profileDelete employee’s profileAdmin has the option to remove employee from the systemSearchAdmin must be able to search for a particular employee2.4 General ConstraintsThere are no items that will limit the developer’s options from designing the system.2.5 Assumptions and DependenciesAssumption1.

So in every action-response of the system, there are no immediate delays. In case of opening windows forms, popping error messages, or saving the settings or sessions the delay must be below 2 seconds. The delay to access the database and to perform operations must be less than 2 seconds. When connecting to the server, the communication and the configuration between systems must be done within 20 seconds.3.4.2 ReliabilityAs the system provides the right tool for discussion, the system must be reliable enough to insert and provide the correct information and must ensure that sensitive data are secured.3.4.3 AvailabilityOne of the big advantages of this system is that it will be based on the cloud and it can be accessed on everywhere and from any device that can access the internet.  Data will be stored online.  The system uses new trends in IT that promote security, availability, and ease of access.3.4.4 SecurityThe main security concern is for users account hence proper login mechanism should be used to avoid hacking. 3.4.5 MaintainabilityAs the system is based on the cloud it will be much easier and cheaper as maintenance is done by the supplier.  The only thing that is required by the user is the web browser only.  If changes need to be made on the system it will only be done on the server side, and little on the client side.3.4.6 PortabilityThe cloud computing concept is all about portability, the system will easily be portable.  There will not be loss of data. 3.4.7 Disaster RecoveryThe risks associated with disasters are going to be handled by the cloud side/data center.3.5 ConstraintsLogin and password identification will have to be provided by users in order to get access to the system.The GUI will only be in English.This system will require an internet connection in order to perform its functionalities.Limited only to HTTP/HTTPS 3.6 Logical Database Requirements/4.
